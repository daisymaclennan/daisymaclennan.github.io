      <p>
        I am a web developer who has been working at Si digital as an apprentice since December 2018. During this time I have worked on building websites using WordPress, React and Next.js. I have also spent time facilitating and formatting requirements for projects that I am working on. For a couple of my projects I have designed and developed the mySQL databases and API endpoints to integrate with them. Although it isnâ€™t my specialty I also enjoy designing user interfaces using Figma and have built a few websites using them (including this one).

        I will write more for this page when I have perfected the other areas of the site.
